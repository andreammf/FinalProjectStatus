Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your instructor!

What have you done for your project so far?
Integrating a Microsoft translator API I could get the extension to work in 4 languages so far. I implemented an option page (option.html) where the user can select a source language and a target language and it will save and update the options selected. Whenever the user highlight a word or sentence in the source language, he/she only needs to right click, select the extension icon and it translates the word/sentence into the target language. 

What have you not done for your project yet?
I haven't implemented a function that allows the user to add their own words into the extension and also, I am missing the weather feature in F°/C°. 

What problems, if any, have you encountered?
Whenever I try to implement a function to allow the user to add/type words into the extension, chrome won't let me load the extension due to an error so I decided not to add that feature yet. I am still looking how to implement the weather function depending on the zipcode of the user.
